            <h2>History of Harajuku fashion</h2>
            <!-- aside: zusätzlisches html tag -->
            <p>Harajuku fashion styles boomed in the 1980s to early 2000s in particular, however, their roots go further back to the 1940s. During that time, the area would become Japan's first ever sophisticated international district. After World War 2, an apartment complex called Washington Heights was built on a vacant lot, previously used for military purposes, in Harajuku. Washington Heights was famous for introducing foreign and especially American families to the area. Over time, the youth around Harajuku got in touch with their new foreign neighbors and their fashion became somewhat westernized.</p>
            <p>In the 1950s, Harajuku's next big construction followed — Omotesando Central Apartments. While they were initially built for the American military, many Japanese creatives stayed there due to the number of available offices. Fashion designers, models and photographers used to meet up at the famous Café Leon, located on the ground floor.Around the 60s, the Americans of Washington Heights moved to a different base which made room for Harajuku's first boutiques, late-night establishments and cafes to open. At the same time, the young fashionable Harajuku kids got their own name, Harajuku-zoku.</p>
            <p>In the 60s and 70s, the apartments in the backstreets of Harajuku (now known as Ura-Hara) were quite affordable and young creatives would set up their atelier to sell their own designs or counterfeit products to sell to smaller shops. Other designers would rent small shops on Takeshita Dori to sell their limited collections to their customers directly.</p>
            <p>In 1964, Japan's first boutique Mademoiselle Non Non opened on the first floor of Central Apartments, followed by Milk right next to it in 1970. These designers maintained creative control due to their small and limited collections and shop size. They were known as Mansion Makers. The name is a homage to their backgrounds as designers, renting small apartments or ateliers in Harajuku to kick off their careers (apartments are called manshon in Japanese). Some of the most famous Mansion Makers from Harajuku today are Milk, Comme des Garcons, and Kansai Yamamoto. These designers got inspiration not only from Harajuku's international flair, but also from visits abroad.</p>
            <p>The following decades would see a rise in creative designs worn on the streets, putting Harajuku's street fashion culture in the spotlight for the decades to come.</p>
            <p>Many looks and styles were captured in the famous FRUiTS magazine, founded in 1997. FRUiTS focused on photographing stylish people around Harajuku (although it did sometimes cover other areas of Tokyo). In addition, the magazine would give a brief description of the person's age, occupation and what their look was inspired by. Sadly FRUiTS stopped print publishing in 2017, but it was far from the end of documenting wild Japanese fashion and Harajuku styles. FRUiTS still exists on Instagram and Shoichi Aoki, the creator of FRUiTS, continued to photograph stylish young people after the magazine ended.</p>
